Aim: Same as F
Do Now: What did advent of DOM achieve? What NOT?
   	It brought about a standard to the way HTML was set up and 
	scripts interacted with the HTML.

Web v1.0 - Static, Consume as a user
Web v2.0 - Dynamic, Post content.

NO FLASH on iOS

HTML5 - introduced to HTML the possibility to add multimedia.

Pair Programming:
1 keyboarder, 1 co-driver, 2 thinkers

HTML: <canvas height="500" width="300" id="c">
      </canvas>

canvas.js:
      var c = document.getElementByID("c");
      var ctx = c.getContext("2d");

Paths used to draw arbitrary shapes, including circles and curves
* A context can keep track of one path at a time.
* The path is not drawn until stroke() is called
* A path is considered done when a new beginPath() is called.

beginPath()
    Starts or resets current path

moveTo(X, Y)
    Moves path to position (x, y)
    Does not result in a line or a filled in section

lineTo(X, Y)

clearRect(

Task:
    dotconn.js

    canvas id: "playground"

    button id: "clear"

    Draws a connected series of dots by adding 1 dot per user click
    (at click location)

    button.addEventListener("click", <fxn>);
    
    clearRect(_,_,_,_);

Useful:
    window.requestAnumationFrame(<fxn>)

* Tells browser to run specified fxn before drawing next frame
* Allows browser to handle when code should be executed.

XML:
  eXtensible Markup Language:
    A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a 
    format which is both human-readable and machine-readable.

    * Not a formatting language (like HTML).
    * Framework for creating markup based grammars.
    * Uses some syntactic standards of HTML (tags, attributes).
    * Focus on sorting and representing data instead of rendering or displaying it.
    * an XML namespace is defined by the tags and attributes associated with a
      specific XML language.

...like SVG:
  * Scalable Vector Graphics
  * Vector image format
  * XML-Based
  * an SVG image and its actions are defined in XML text files.
  
  Vector graphics are images that are not represented as a 2d grid of pixels 
  (raster) but instead as a list of drawing commands (like line, circle, rectangle,
  curve,...).
  
  Biggest advantage to vector graphics is that they are scalable any size without
  resulting in pixelation.
  
  the <svg> element is designed to store SVG code (that is, SVG XML elements)
  
    <svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      <SVG CODE HERE
    </svg>
    
    xmlns
      Attribute that identifies the namespace for the specific XML language being
      used.

    Creating SVG elements in javascript
      document.createElementsNS(<NAMESPACE IDENTIFIER>, <ELEMETNT>);
        creates an element from a specidfied XML namespace
	svg example:
	  var c1 = document.createElementNS("https://www.w3.org/2000/svg", circle);
	  c1.setAttribute("cx", "200");

Selectors
Like jquert, you can select DOM elements using d3 functions
d3.select(<IDENTIFIER>); --> returns first
d3.selectAll(<IDENTIFIER>); --> returns array

So why d3?

After selecting an element, you can change attributes...

...and and AND!! also pass functions to set the values dynamically:

d3.selectAll("p")
    .style("font-size", 
        function() {
            return Math.floor(Math.random() * 15) + "px"


var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
data
var chart = d3.select(".chart");
chart
var bar = chart.selectAll("div");
bar
var barUpdate = bar.data(data);
barUpdate
var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");

d --> indicates 

barEnter.style("width", function(d) {
    return d * 10 + "px"; });

label each bar.
barEnter.text(function(d) { return d; });

var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
d3.select(".chart")
  .selectAll("div")
    .data(data)
  .enter().append("div")
    .style("width", function(d) {
             return d * 10 + "px"; })
    .text( function(d) { return d; } );

Enter selection:
Collection of placeholder nodes for each data element for which no corresponding
existing DOM element was found.

Closures
1. A function is declared inside of another function.
2. Inner function accesses a variable from the outer function (outside of the local 
   scope of the inner function)
3. The external function binds a value to the variable and finished (or closes)
   before the inner function can be completed.

  def repeat(s):
    def times(x):
      return s * x
    return times

This is an example of a nested function, but NOT a closure because s, the external
variable to times, is not bounf to any value.

  r1 = repeat("hello")

This created a closure because repeat runs, bunds s to "hello", then exits, 
returning a function (times) with s bound to "hello"

  r1(2)

Aim: Decoration Day
DN: In a new .py file, define the following functions. Predict the output of
    flist[1](5) before running

def inc(x):
    return x + 1

def dec(x):
    return x - 1

f = inc
print f(5) --> ?

flist = [inc, dec]

A simple closure in Python:

def makeAdder(n):
    def	inner(x):
        return x + n
    return inner

add3 = makeAdder(3)
add5 = makeAdder(5)

add3(10) --> 13
add5(10) --> 5

A clunky approach to class type abstraction:
TASK: simulate a class definition using inner functions

def make_counter():
    # private "instance" data
    # python scopring rules necessitate list
    count = [0]

    # public methods
    def inc():
    	count[0] = count[0] + 1
    def dec():
    	count[0] = count[0] - 1
    def reset():
    	count[0] = 0
    def get():
    	return count[0]

    # return dictionary to allow access to all methods
    return {'inc': inc, 'dec': dec, 'reset': reset, 'get': get}

Instantiate counters:
c1 = make_counter()
c2 = make_counter()

Must use clunky list notation:
c1['inc']()
c1['inc']()
c1['inc']()
print c1['get']() --> ?

c2['inc']()
print c2['get']() --> ?

getname.py:
import random
def get_name():
    names = ['tom', 'sue', 'harry', 'lisa', 'sarah', 'horatio']
    return random.choice(names)


def dble(f):
    name = f()
    return name+name

print dble(get_name)

WE CAN DO BETTER:
a la this old idiom for updating a var:
i = i + 1

...you can redefine a fxn in terms of itself!

get_name = dble(get_name)

decorators.py:
import random

def doubler(f):
    def inner():
        name = f()
        return name+name
    return inner

@doubler
def get_name():
    names = ['tom', 'sue', 'harry', 'lisa', 'sarah', 'horatio']
    return random.choice(names)

print get_name()

TAKEAWAY:
You can write functions that transform fxns.

A python decorator is shorthand for calling a wrapper type function like doubler.

A python decorator encapsulates a closure.

A python decorator allows you to transparently wrap functionality
