    Late 90's: Enter the DOM
    W3C (World Wide Web Consortion) forms, introduces
    
    Document Object Model
    * Organizes components of a webpage as a tree.
    * Provides API for languages like JS to access page elements.

Aim: Same as F
Do Now: What did advent of DOM achieve? What NOT?
   	It brought about a standard to the way HTML was set up and 
	scripts interacted with the HTML.

Web v1.0 - Static, Consume as a user
Web v2.0 - Dynamic, Post content.

NO FLASH on iOS

HTML5 - introduced to HTML the possibility to add multimedia.

Pair Programming:
1 keyboarder, 1 co-driver, 2 thinkers

HTML: <canvas height="500" width="300" id="c">
      </canvas>

canvas.js:
      var c = document.getElementByID("c");
      var ctx = c.getContext("2d");

Paths used to draw arbitrary shapes, including circles and curves
* A context can keep track of one path at a time.
* The path is not drawn until stroke() is called
* A path is considered done when a new beginPath() is called.

beginPath()
    Starts or resets current path

moveTo(X, Y)
    Moves path to position (x, y)
    Does not result in a line or a filled in section

lineTo(X, Y)

clearRect(

Task:
    dotconn.js

    canvas id: "playground"

    button id: "clear"

    Draws a connected series of dots by adding 1 dot per user click
    (at click location)

    button.addEventListener("click", <fxn>);
    
    clearRect(_,_,_,_);

Useful:
    window.requestAnumationFrame(<fxn>)

* Tells browser to run specified fxn before drawing next frame
* Allows browser to handle when code should be executed.

XML:
  eXtensible Markup Language:
    A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a 
    format which is both human-readable and machine-readable.

    * Not a formatting language (like HTML).
    * Framework for creating markup based grammars.
    * Uses some syntactic standards of HTML (tags, attributes).
    * Focus on sorting and representing data instead of rendering or displaying it.
    * an XML namespace is defined by the tags and attributes associated with a
      specific XML language.

...like SVG:
  * Scalable Vector Graphics
  * Vector image format
  * XML-Based
  * an SVG image and its actions are defined in XML text files.
  
  Vector graphics are images that are not represented as a 2d grid of pixels 
  (raster) but instead as a list of drawing commands (like line, circle, rectangle,
  curve,...).
  
  Biggest advantage to vector graphics is that they are scalable any size without
  resulting in pixelation.
  
  the <svg> element is designed to store SVG code (that is, SVG XML elements)
  
    <svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      <SVG CODE HERE
    </svg>
    
    xmlns
      Attribute that identifies the namespace for the specific XML language being
      used.

    Creating SVG elements in javascript
      document.createElementsNS(<NAMESPACE IDENTIFIER>, <ELEMETNT>);
        creates an element from a specidfied XML namespace
	svg example:
	  var c1 = document.createElementNS("https://www.w3.org/2000/svg", circle);
	  c1.setAttribute("cx", "200");
